# Recycle_Can_iOS
iOS version with the full and much more functionality of the Recycle Can website. Recycle Can provides locations for Canadians to recycle household potentially hazardous waste such as electronics, batteries, and paint. To run the application, it can be found on the iOS app store. Otherwise, manual isntallation can be done through this repository with a few simple steps

# Manual Instruction
1. Download this entire repository
2. Under the 'Recycle_Can' folder (not the initial Recycle_Can_iOS folder), find the 'Recycle Can.xcworkspace' file. Open this file with Xcode
3. Click 'Run' on the top left. To optimize much of the project's functionality, open the application in your own iOS device by connecting the device to your computer and selecting it in the drop down menu to the right of the 'Run' button. Otherwise, the iOS simulator option still works but some functionality like multi-gesture commands will not run smoothly.

# Database Files
As the database is very large and includes lots of raw HTML data, it has been linked to a google drive folder rather than taking up unnecessary space on the git.
